# DiaconisDecode
A program for deciphering ciphertexts using war and peace novel's letter frequencies. Diaconis's method is implemented here. This is a project for Rogaway's ECS 127 (Cryptography) class at UC Davis.

decodefv4.cpp is the final version. The ciphertext is hardcoded into the source code. Make sure to have the warpeace.txt file in the same folder as the executable. Then run the executable file accordingly.
